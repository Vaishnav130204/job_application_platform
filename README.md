Objective:

This guide outlines the development of a full-stack Job Listing Platform using Node.js, Express, React, and a relational database. The primary objective is to create a functional web application that allows users to register, log in, and manage job listings, while adhering to secure coding practices and modern development standards. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of full-stack development principles, including user authentication, data management, API design, and UI/UX considerations. Successfully completing this assignment will showcase your ability to build a complete web application with a robust feature set.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

I. Project Setup and Initialization:

Create Project Directory: Create a new directory for your project. This directory will house both the backend and frontend code. Consider structuring it with separate folders for "backend" and "frontend."

Initialize Backend: Navigate to the "backend" directory in your terminal.

Initialize a Node.js project using npm init -y.
Install necessary backend dependencies: npm install express bcrypt jsonwebtoken sequelize mysql2 dotenv cors helmet express-rate-limit. Note: Replace mysql2 with pg and appropriate Sequelize dialect packages if choosing PostgreSQL.
Initialize Frontend: Navigate to the "frontend" directory in your terminal.

Create a new React application using npx create-react-app . or your preferred method (e.g., Vite).
Install necessary frontend dependencies: npm install react-router-dom axios. You may also want to install a UI library like Material UI, Ant Design, or Bootstrap.
Database Setup:

Install MySQL or PostgreSQL on your local machine or use a cloud-based database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL).
Create a database schema specifically for the job listing platform.
Configure your database connection details in a .env file within your "backend" directory. Include variables for host, database name, username, and password.
ORM Configuration:

Configure Sequelize to connect to your database by creating a config/config.json or config/config.js file in your "backend" directory.
Define your database models (e.g., User, Job Listing, Bookmark) using Sequelize's model definition syntax. Each model should map to a table in your database.
Use Sequelize migrations or seeders to create the initial database schema and seed the database with sample data (optional).
II. Development Process:

A. Backend (Node.js & Express):

Server Setup: Create an index.js or server.js file in your "backend" directory.

Import necessary modules (Express, CORS, Helmet, rateLimit).
Initialize an Express application.
Configure middleware:
CORS: Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend access.
Helmet: Implement security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
rateLimit: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
JSON parsing middleware to handle request bodies.
Connect to your database using Sequelize.
Define API routes (see below).
Start the server and listen on a specified port (e.g., 3001).
User Authentication API Endpoints:

Signup (POST /api/auth/signup):
Receive user registration data (username, email, password).
Validate user input.
Hash the password using bcrypt.
Create a new user record in the database using Sequelize.
Return a success message.
Login (POST /api/auth/login):
Receive user login data (username/email, password).
Validate user input.
Retrieve the user from the database based on username/email.
Compare the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database using bcrypt.
If authentication is successful, generate a JWT token containing user information (e.g., user ID, role).
Return the JWT token to the client.
Job Listing API Endpoints:

Create Job Listing (POST /api/jobs):
Require authentication (verify JWT token).
Extract job listing data from the request body.
Validate user input.
Create a new job listing record in the database using Sequelize, associating it with the currently logged-in user.
Return the newly created job listing object.
Read All Job Listings (GET /api/jobs):
Make the API endpoint publicly accessible (no authentication required).
Fetch all job listings from the database using Sequelize.
Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering based on query parameters (e.g., page, limit, sort, location, jobType, salaryRange).
Return the job listings in a JSON response.
Read Single Job Listing (GET /api/jobs/:id):
Make the API endpoint publicly accessible (no authentication required).
Extract the job listing ID from the request parameters.
Fetch the job listing from the database using Sequelize.
Return the job listing object.
Update Job Listing (PUT /api/jobs/:id):
Require authentication (verify JWT token).
Extract the job listing ID from the request parameters.
Verify that the logged-in user owns the job listing before allowing the update.
Update the job listing record in the database using Sequelize.
Return the updated job listing object.
Delete Job Listing (DELETE /api/jobs/:id):
Require authentication (verify JWT token).
Extract the job listing ID from the request parameters.
Verify that the logged-in user owns the job listing before allowing the deletion.
Delete the job listing record from the database using Sequelize.
Return a success message.
Bookmark API Endpoints:

Bookmark a Job (POST /api/bookmarks/:jobId):
Require authentication.
Create a record in a "bookmarks" table linking the user and the job.
Get Bookmarked Jobs (GET /api/bookmarks):
Require authentication.
Fetch all jobs bookmarked by the user.
Middleware Functions:

Authentication Middleware: Create a middleware function to verify JWT tokens in the Authorization header of requests. If the token is valid, extract the user ID from the token and attach it to the request object (e.g., req.userId).
Authorization Middleware: Create middleware functions to check user roles or permissions before allowing access to certain routes. For example, you could have an isAdmin middleware function that checks if the logged-in user has the "admin" role.
Error Handling Middleware: Implement a global error handling middleware function to catch and handle errors gracefully. Log errors and return appropriate error responses to the client (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
Validation Middleware: Create reusable middleware functions to validate request bodies against predefined schemas using libraries like Joi or express-validator.
B. Frontend (React):

Component Structure: Organize your React application into reusable components. Consider components for:

Authentication (Login, Signup)
Job Listing (JobCard, JobDetails, JobForm)
User Dashboard (JobListings, Profile, Bookmarks)
Navigation (Header, Footer)
Routing: Use react-router-dom to handle client-side routing. Define routes for:

Home (Job Listings)
Login
Signup
Job Details (/jobs/:id)
User Dashboard (/dashboard)
Create Job Listing (/jobs/new)
Edit Job Listing (/jobs/:id/edit)
API Communication: Use axios to make API requests to your backend. Create functions to handle:

User authentication (login, signup). Store the JWT token in localStorage or a cookie after successful login.
Fetching job listings.
Creating, updating, and deleting job listings.
Bookmarking jobs.
State Management: Use React's built-in useState hook or a state management library like Redux or Context API to manage application state (e.g., user authentication status, job listing data).

Forms: Implement forms for user registration, login, and job listing creation/editing. Handle form submissions and validation. Display appropriate error messages to the user.

User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface based on the provided Figma design.

Toast Messages: Implement toast notifications using a library like react-toastify or react-hot-toast to provide feedback to the user on successful actions or errors (e.g., successful login, failed login attempt, job listing created successfully).

III. Styling and Design:

CSS Framework (Optional): Consider using a CSS framework like Material UI, Ant Design, Tailwind CSS, or Bootstrap to streamline styling and ensure consistency.
Component-Based Styling: Apply styles to individual components using CSS modules, styled-components, or CSS-in-JS techniques.
Responsive Design: Ensure that your application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using media queries or a responsive CSS framework.
Follow Figma Design: Adhere to the Figma design provided for layout, color scheme, typography, and overall visual style.
IV. Deployment:

Choose a Platform: Select a deployment platform such as Render, Vercel, AWS (EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Amplify), or Google Cloud Platform (App Engine, Cloud Run).
Configure Environment Variables: Set the necessary environment variables on your deployment platform (e.g., database connection details, JWT secret key).
Backend Deployment: Deploy your Node.js Express backend to the chosen platform. Follow the platform's specific deployment instructions. This usually involves creating a Procfile or similar configuration file to specify the start command for your server.
Frontend Deployment: Deploy your React frontend to the same or a different platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3). Configure the frontend to point to the deployed backend API endpoint.
Database Configuration: Ensure that your deployed backend can connect to your database. This may involve configuring network settings, firewall rules, or using a connection pool.
Domain and SSL: Configure a custom domain name for your application and enable SSL (HTTPS) to secure your application.
